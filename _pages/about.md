Well hello there! I am Hrishi. I am a Research Scientist at Global Institute for Water Security at University of Saskatchewan in Canada, and a Fellow at Centre for Earth and Environment at FLAME University in India. 

My research interests comprise studying large-scale water cycle changes, investigating their climatic- and human- causes, and understanding the implications of these changes on other spheres of the earth system, such as the ocean and the cryopshere, as well as the society and ecosystems. Through my research, I attempt to address questions such as ‘How does land hydrology influence the sea level?’, 'What would intensification of the water cycle look like?', ‘How does climate variability influence land water storage?’, and ‘How big are the human-driven hydrologic changes in the context of natural climate variability?’. To address these questions, I combine multiple approaches such as remote sensing, field observations, and climate-model simulations and outputs. 

The inspiration for my research comes from my love and appreciation of the natural world around me. I absolutely love being in the remote backcountry, sometimes doing nothing, sometimes watercolor painting, and other times trail running, mountain biking, hiking, backpacking, rock climbing, mountaineering and backcountry skiing. 


<!-- mainly study large-scale changes in the hydrologic cycle


I study Earth System Science (ESS). ESS lets me study all the spheres of the natural world and explore their connections. Essentially studying Gaia hypothesis, but scientifically!

Specifically, I study large-scale changes in the hydrologic cycle,

My love for mountains often finds me winter mountaineering and backcountry skiing, trad and alpine climbing, and winter backpacking in the Colorado Rockies and the Sierras, and trail running and mountain biking in the local San Gabriels. My preferred medium for expressing my appreciation for nature is spontaneous plein air water colors. When home, I enjoy relaxing by cooking, listening to jazz, and attempting to improvise on mandolin and harmonica.

This site is a one stop to be updated with all the things I'm up to! So please stay tuned! -->
