Thanks for stopping by!

Dr. Hrishikesh Arvind Chandanpurkar is an Earth System Scientist working with Arizona State University, USA. He has a Ph.D. in Earth System Sciences from University of California, Irvine, an M.Sc. in Environmental Sciences and a B.Sc. in Geology from University of Pune, India. Previously, he has conducted research at NASA / Caltech Jet Propulsion Laboratory (Pasadena, USA), the Department of Aerospace Engineering at University of Colorado, Boulder, USA, and Global Institute for Water Security, Saskatoon, Canada. His research interests mainly comprise studying water cycle changes at multiple spatiotemporal scales, investigating their climatic- and human- causes and their implications for socio-ecological and climate systems. He has taught several courses at undergraduate and graduate level in earth sciences in the US and in India.

The inspiration for his research comes from his love and appreciation of the natural world around him. He loves being in the remote backcountry, sometimes doing nothing, occasionally painting or photographing the landscapes, and other times doing a range of activities (such as trail running, mountain biking, hiking, backpacking, rock climbing, mountaineering, and backcountry skiing) that provide him with an endless supply of Type 2 fun. He lives in Calgary, Canada.

<!-- mainly study large-scale changes in the hydrologic cycle


I study Earth System Science (ESS). ESS lets me study all the spheres of the natural world and explore their connections. Essentially studying Gaia hypothesis, but scientifically!

Specifically, I study large-scale changes in the hydrologic cycle,

My love for mountains often finds me winter mountaineering and backcountry skiing, trad and alpine climbing, and winter backpacking in the Colorado Rockies and the Sierras, and trail running and mountain biking in the local San Gabriels. My preferred medium for expressing my appreciation for nature is spontaneous plein air water colors. When home, I enjoy relaxing by cooking, listening to jazz, and attempting to improvise on mandolin and harmonica.

This site is a one stop to be updated with all the things I'm up to! So please stay tuned! -->
