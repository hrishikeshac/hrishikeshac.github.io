Welcome to my website!

I am an earth system scientist, currently a Consultant with the World Bank and a Fellow at the Centre for Sustainability, Environment, and Climate Change, FLAME University, India. 

My research interests mainly comprise of
1. studying large-scale water cycle changes,
2. investigating their climatic- and human- causes, and
3. understanding the implications of these changes on other spheres of the earth system, such as the ocean and the cryosphere, as well as the society and ecosystems.  

Through my research, I attempt to address questions such as ‘How does land hydrology influence the sea level?’, 'What would intensification of the water cycle look like?', ‘How does climate variability influence land water storage?’, and ‘How big are the human-driven hydrologic changes in the context of natural climate variability?’. I combine multiple approaches such as remote sensing, field observations, and climate-model simulations and outputs to address these questions. 

The inspiration for my research comes from my love and appreciation of the natural world around me. I love being in the remote backcountry, sometimes doing nothing, occasionally watercolor painting, and other times doing a range of activities (such as trail running, mountain biking, hiking, backpacking, rock climbing, mountaineering, and backcountry skiing) that provide me with an endless supply of Type 2 fun.

<!-- mainly study large-scale changes in the hydrologic cycle


I study Earth System Science (ESS). ESS lets me study all the spheres of the natural world and explore their connections. Essentially studying Gaia hypothesis, but scientifically!

Specifically, I study large-scale changes in the hydrologic cycle,

My love for mountains often finds me winter mountaineering and backcountry skiing, trad and alpine climbing, and winter backpacking in the Colorado Rockies and the Sierras, and trail running and mountain biking in the local San Gabriels. My preferred medium for expressing my appreciation for nature is spontaneous plein air water colors. When home, I enjoy relaxing by cooking, listening to jazz, and attempting to improvise on mandolin and harmonica.

This site is a one stop to be updated with all the things I'm up to! So please stay tuned! -->
